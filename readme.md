### I. Dimensions, Terminology and Review of Basic Fluid Mechanics

### A. Dimensions

1. **One-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables such as depth (Y) and velocity (V) are only a function of x.

2. **Two-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables such as depth (Y) and velocity (V) are functions of two directions (e.g. x & y or x & z).

3. **Three-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables are functions of axes x, y and z
