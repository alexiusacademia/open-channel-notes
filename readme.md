# Open Channel Flow



### I. Dimensions, Terminology and Review of Basic Fluid Mechanics

### A. Dimensions

1. **One-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables such as depth (Y) and velocity (V) are only a function of x.

2. **Two-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables such as depth (Y) and velocity (V) are functions of two directions (e.g. x & y or x & z).

3. **Three-Dimensional Flow**

   > flow variables are functions of axes x, y and z

### B. Fluid Flow

 1. **Steady Flow**

    > None of the flow variables can describe the flow change with respect to time.
    >
    > $$
    > \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = 0 , \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t} = 0, \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = 0
    > $$

    
    
 2. **Unsteady Flow**

    > If any variable that describes the flow changes with time.



3. **Uniform Flow**

   > When none of the flow variables changes with respect to `x`, direction of the channel flow.
   >
   > A flow is uniform if the depth, velocity and cross-sectional area are constant.

3. **Nonuniform Flow**

   > If any of the variables of the flow varies from position to position.

   3.1. ***Gradually Varied***

   - The pressure will increase in the vertical direction just as in uniform flow *(hydrostatic pressure)*.

   3.2. ***Rapidly Varied***

   - Change in depth is too rapid and the pressure distribution is not hydrostatic.

   3.3. ***Spatially Varied***

   - Those portions of the main channel flow wherein lateral inflow or outflow occurs.
